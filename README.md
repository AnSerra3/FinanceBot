# Trader Bot

## !!DISCLAIMER!!

This is one of my first python project using the mt5 library, which was used to create a personal trader bot.

The program has 2 well-structured parts:

- The first one is a personal strategy function. It tries to exploit the standard deviation as a tool to understand wether it's the best time to buy or sell in the crypto market.

- The second part is a market order, a function that sends a request with all the details needed to open an order through the use of a complete python dictionary.
