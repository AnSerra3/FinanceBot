# Trader Bot

This is one of my first python project using mt5 library, very usefull to create personal trader bot...

Obviously I don't raccomand it to trade with lot's of money, it need some adjustment, but for now it does its job.



The program has 2 well-structured parts:

- The first one is a personal strategy function. It tries to exploit the standard deviation as a tool to understand if it is the best time to buy or sell in the crypto market.

- The second part is the market order, a function that sends a request with all the details needed to open the order through the use of a complete python dictionary.
